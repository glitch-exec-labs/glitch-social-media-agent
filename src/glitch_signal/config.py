"""Central configuration for Glitch Social Media Agent.

All settings are loaded from .env (or environment variables).
Call settings() anywhere — the result is cached after first load.

Brand configs live in brand/configs/<brand_id>.json (gitignored). Each file
is validated against brand/schema/brand.config.schema.json and merged into
settings().brands. Legacy brand.config.json at repo root is still honoured
and registered as the default brand for backward compatibility.
