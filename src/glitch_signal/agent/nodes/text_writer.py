"""TextWriter node — generates a text post per enabled text platform for a Signal.

Replaces the script_writer → storyboard → video_generator chain for brands
with content_format="text" (glitch_executor, glitch_founder). Output per
signal is one ContentScript per enabled upload_post_* text platform, each
paired with a ScheduledPost (status=pending_veto) so the existing Telegram
approve/veto + scheduler dispatch works unchanged.

The LLM prompt is brand-aware:
  - brand voice prompt          (brand/prompts/<brand>_voice.md)
  - platform playbook           (brand/prompts/platform_playbook.md)
  - per-platform rules enforced (char limits, link placement)
