"""Create (or refresh) the Glitch posts sheet and seed it with drafted rows.

The sheet is the single source of truth for queued text posts. Scheduler
tick reads it, picks the next due row (pacing-respecting), posts via
Upload-Post, writes the result back.

Workflow:
  1. Run this script ONCE to create the sheet. It prints the URL + ID.
  2. Paste the ID into .env as GLITCH_POSTS_SHEET_ID.
  3. Share the sheet with your personal Google account (the SA already has
     access since it created the sheet). Optional but lets you edit on
     the fly from a browser.
  4. Restart the agent service. Scheduler tick begins firing queued rows
     within ~5 min, respecting the 4h per-(brand,platform) interval and
     2/day cap configured in settings.

Re-running the script after setup: if GLITCH_POSTS_SHEET_ID is already set,
the script refuses to re-seed — you probably don't want to wipe or
duplicate your posting calendar. Pass --force to append fresh drafts on
top of the existing queue.
